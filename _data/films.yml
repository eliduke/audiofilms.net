- title: Ace Ventura
  description: They always say that you gotta get started on the right foot, but what about left-footed people? Seems to me like they would be better off getting started on the left foot. Either way, this movie really gets going on the correct foot. It opens to Ace impersonating a UPS driver while delivering a package and he is really letting that package have it. Can you imagine if UPS drivers were really like that? Oh man! So anyway, he tricks this mustached strong guy and steals his dog. Well, it's actually not his dog, it's someone else's dog and the mustached guy stole it from that person and Ace is simply trying to steal it back because he's a freaking Pet Detective. How cool is that? Anyhoo, he gets outside and is about to drive away when the mustached guy comes outside with a baseball bat and uses Ace's car as target practice. Hilarity ensues.

  description: Wouldn't it be sweet to go back in time to the 1970s and be able to just throw your trash on the ground and think that was actually an acceptable thing to do? Just imagine, driving down the road, drinking a beer, taking that last big pull, and then tossing that sucker right out the window. Oh man! But seriously, can you imagine if we were still like that?

- title: Back to the Future
  description: The movie opens with the sounds of lots of ticking clocks and news about missing Plutonium that was possibly stolen from Pacific Nuclear Research Facility. Strange machines are doing unheard of things and then enters Marty McFly. He plugs some things in, twiddles some dials, cranks that shit up, and then blows himself to smithereens. Climbing out of the rubble, the phone rings. It's Doc. He needs some help, but what's more important is that Marty is LATE FOR SCHOOL!! Cue Huey Lewis and the skateboard.

- title: Ladykillers
  description: "You know what they say: one person's trash is another person's treasure. This movie is a perfect example of that in my life because my brother thinks this movie is straight up trash (for reals), and I can't get enough of it. This is by far one of Tom Hanks' best roles. He kills it from start to finish. And I can't ever get enough of J.K. Simmons, so that's just like the cherry on top.  What a treasure!"

- title: Mean Girls
  description: I haven't seen this movie near enough as much as I should. It is so incredibly quotable and hilarious and it's some early Tina Fey, which we can all rally behind. And let's not forget Lindsay Lohan. Like seriously, I think we as a society, collectively, are teetering on the edge of completely forgetting that Lindsay Lohan ever existed. Think about it! She was on top. She was the shit, and now she has just faded to black. When was the last time you every heard anything about her that wasn't tabloid bullshit? Lindsay, if you are reading this, we still love you. Let's do lunch sometime.

- title: A Mighty Wind
  description: Christopher Guest has done it again, but this time it's even better because there's some really fantastic original music that he and Eugene Levy have created. It's unreal all the different bands with individual styles that they created. And just think about all those old "archive" shots that they created with the actors as they are now. That is some serious movie magic right there. That's what I'm talking about! And this movie more than any other Christopher Guest movie makes me realize how sweet of a thing that that crew has going for itself. You can see how much fun they are all having. Obviously it's a movie and some work needs to get done, but it's also just an awesome excuse for that crew together and hang out and have fun and make a movie. What a dream come true.

- title: Pee-Wee's Big Adventure
  description: This is my brother's all-time number one favorite movie ever. At first I remember thinking it was a little ridiculous to even consider any one movie being your most favorite movie ever, but I imagine that it must be pretty nice knowing. From that point forward you always have something against which you can base all other movies. Pee-wee's Big Adventure is a 10/10, that's your starting point. Go forward from there.

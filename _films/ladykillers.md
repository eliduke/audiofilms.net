  The Ladykillers
permalink: ladykillers
description: >
  An eccentric, if not charming Southern professor and his crew pose as a band in order to rob a casino, all under the nose of his unsuspecting landlord â€“ a sharp old woman. You know what they say: one person's trash is another person's treasure. This movie is a perfect example of that in my life because my brother thinks this movie is straight up trash (for reals), and I can't get enough of it. This is by far one of Tom Hanks' best roles. He kills it from start to finish. And I can't ever get enough of J.K. Simmons, so that's just like the cherry on top. What a treasure!

description: I haven't seen this movie near enough as much as I should. It is so incredibly quotable and hilarious and it's some early Tina Fey, which we can all rally behind. And let's not forget Lindsay Lohan. Like seriously, I think we as a society, collectively, are teetering on the edge of completely forgetting that Lindsay Lohan ever existed. Think about it! She was on top. She was the shit, and now she has just faded to black. When was the last time you every heard anything about her that wasn't tabloid bullshit? Lindsay, if you are reading this, we still love you. Let's do lunch sometime.

description: "You know what they say: one person's trash is another person's treasure. This movie is a perfect example of that in my life because my brother thinks this movie is straight up trash (for reals), and I can't get enough of it. This is by far one of Tom Hanks' best roles. He kills it from start to finish. And I can't ever get enough of J.K. Simmons, so that's just like the cherry on top.  What a treasure!"

description: Humanity finds a mysterious object buried beneath the lunar surface and sets off to find its origins with the help of HAL 9000, the world's most advanced super computer. (Someone requested this as a joke and we absolutely had to take that joke to its furthest conclusion. The first spoken words aren't heard until nearly 30 minutes into the film! Pretty funny.)

Well over a decade ago, I was road-tripping somewhere with Brandon, one my oldest and dearest friends, and he brought along his portable DVD player. Cool. You might not know this, but Brandon was a big DVD guy back then. He eventually shifted to Blu-ray when it made sense, but in recent years he dipped a toe into VHS before taking a **hard** turn toward LaserDisc. Double cool.

Anyhoo, so I'm road-tripping with Brandon and his portable DVD player. He starts popping DVDs into that thing and sends the audio straight to aux on the car stereo! We had it *made*. More often than not I was the one driving, with my eyes on the road, just listening to the movies that Brandon was watching. I was having a great time.

After toying with the idea for a couple years, I finally purchased the domain way back in 2014 (a literal decade ago), wired up a simple Ruby on Rails, and got the first 20 or so films into the catalogue. It was fun, but also kinda boring. Turns out that part of the project, adding to the catalogue, was a bit too cumbersome and didn't really excite me. Things grew stale, eventually [the hosting provider eliminated their free option](https://help.heroku.com/RSBRUH58/removal-of-heroku-free-product-plans-faq), and I wasn't about to pay a monthly fee for this silly idea.

Fast-forward another 10 years and I have been inspired yet again! It's time to get this thing back online and really build up the catalogue.

With the latest and greatest in [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), I am able to recreate what I once and make it better, easier, etc. New titles will get added weekly-ish, and please [send a request](mailto:request@audiofilms.net?subject=I%27ve%20got%20an%20idea%20for%20an%20AudioFilm) if you don't see your favorite movies on the list!
